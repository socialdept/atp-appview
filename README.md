## What is ATP AppView?

**ATP AppView** turns a Laravel application into an AT Protocol AppView:

- **Ingest:** sync any set of collections from the network through Tap or Tab, in batches, without flooding the app during backfill.
- **Index:** keep every ingested record in the application's own database, queryable through Eloquent.
- **XRPC:** serve queries and procedures generated from lexicons, with custom handlers where the default is not enough.
- **Auth:** one guard that works whether OAuth tokens live on the server or in the browser, with service proxying in both cases.

It builds on [atp-client](https://github.com/socialdept/atp-client) for OAuth, service auth and forwarding, and on [atp-schema](https://github.com/socialdept/atp-schema) for lexicons.

## Installation

```bash
composer require socialdept/atp-appview
```

## The atp guard

The `atp` guard answers one question per request: which DID is the viewer, and how did they prove it. It returns your `User` model, so `auth()`, Gates and policies work unchanged.

Add it next to your session guard in `config/auth.php`:

```php
'guards' => [
    'web' => ['driver' => 'session', 'provider' => 'users'],
    'atp' => ['driver' => 'atp', 'provider' => 'users', 'session_guard' => 'web'],
],
```

Your user model implements `HasAtpSession` from atp-client, returning its DID.

### Resolution order

1. **A bearer JWT** is verified as service auth with atp-client: the signature against the issuer's DID document, expiry, `ATP_SERVICE_AUTH_AUDIENCE` (a bare DID also matches a combined `did#serviceId`), and the route's NSID as `lxm`. A bearer that fails is a 401 and never falls back to the session. OAuth access tokens sent by mistake are refused.
2. **The session guard** supplies the user when there is no bearer.
3. **Neither** leaves the viewer anonymous.

### Protecting XRPC routes

```php
Route::get('/xrpc/com.example.getTimeline', GetTimeline::class)
    ->middleware('atp.viewer:required,com.example.getTimeline');

Route::get('/xrpc/com.example.getThread', GetThread::class)
    ->middleware('atp.viewer:optional,com.example.getThread');
```

The first argument is `required` or `optional`. The second is the NSID the route answers to, which a service auth token must be bound to: a route without one accepts the session only. Errors use the XRPC shape, such as `{"error": "AuthenticationRequired", "message": "..."}`. Plain `auth:atp` works too, for routes that only need a user.

### The viewer

```php
$viewer = $request->viewer();

$viewer->did;              // who is calling
$viewer->source;           // ViewerSource::Session or ViewerSource::ServiceAuth
$viewer->method;           // the NSID a service auth token was bound to
$viewer->user();           // the local user, if any
$viewer->isService();      // true for a did#serviceId issuer
$viewer->canActOnRepo();   // true when the server holds a session for this DID
$viewer->client();         // Atp::as($did), or null in frontend mode
```

Write to the user's repo only when `canActOnRepo()` is true. In frontend mode the browser holds the tokens, writes to the repo itself, and the AppView changes only its own state.

### Provisioning and services

A verified DID with no local user gets one keyed by `did_column` when `provision` is `create`, the default. Users are only ever created from a verified credential, never from a DID in a request body. Set `provision` to `none` to leave the viewer without a user instead.

An issuer with a fragment, such as `did:web:feed.example#bsky_fg`, is a service rather than a person. It is only accepted when listed in `auth.trusted_services`, and is never provisioned.
